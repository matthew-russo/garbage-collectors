This repository houses some very basic implementations of different Garbage Collection algorithms, 
as described in The Garbage Collection Handbook.

The goal is not to have a legitimate garbage collector or even a program that can be used
outside of this repository, but instead to shed a little bit of light on Garbage Collection
in an accessible manner.
